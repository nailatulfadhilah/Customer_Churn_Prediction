# Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn prediction uses data to detect customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions and is used by most of the large subscription businesses to identify customers most at-risk of churning. By doing customer churn prediction, the company can retain more customers and prevent losses due to customer churn.

I built a customer churn prediction model using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Voting Classifier.
